# Tkinter-Calculator
A calculator made entirely in python using the tkinter module. Another Tkinter project for school.
Run the calc.py file to run the calculator.

# Requirements
To run this calculator program, you don't need anything. But in some cases, the tkinter GUI interface can be a bit laggy. For those exterme cases, running the calculator on a computer having at least an i3 processor would work fine.

Hope you like the GUI Calculator!
